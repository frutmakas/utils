## Notice to all
This is a copy of incomplete codes with unknown version. I am recontructing the lost library which was developed 16 years ago.
It is here for to simplify my reconstruction. 

These files were and still for personal use. Some codes may be copied from somewhere. Those codes may have notices or attribution removed due to hard disk space constrains. I was poor and cannot afford storage bigger than 20MB. Extreme optimisation of spaces may have occured.

**Expect a lot of bugs.** 

Things can fail spectacularly. 

Your private info may be sucked out. 
Your toaster may catch fire. 
Your fridge may become sentient. 
Your spouse may hate you forever.


The best is not to use this library at all. Don't even look. Run away, far far away.
