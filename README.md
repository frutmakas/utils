## Notice to all
This is a copy of incomplete codes with unknown version. I am recontructing the lost library which was developed 16 years ago.
It is here for to simplify my reconstruction. 

**Expect a lot of bugs.** 

Things can fail spectacularly. 

Your private info may be sucked out. 
Your toaster may catch fire. 
Your fridge may become sentient. 
Your spouse may hate you forever.


The best is not to use this library at all and run away, far far away.
